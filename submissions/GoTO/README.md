**Name:** GoTO

**Description:** As a long-time resident of Toronto, I’ve become increasingly concerned by the growing amount of litter in my neighborhood. This issue not only affects the cleanliness of our city but also has serious environmental consequences. What’s even more troubling is that much of this litter is caused by people in my generation. Research shows that individuals under 30 are more likely to litter than those who are older. To address this, GoTO was created as a way to encourage young people to take action and clean up litter by offering digital rewards. These rewards come in the form of adorable animal avatars, which make the experience fun and engaging. The app allows users to track their impact in real-time, with a map that shows the locations where litter has been picked up and a calendar that tracks the amount of litter collected over time. GoTO empowers youth to see the positive difference they’re making, one piece of litter at a time.
