Name: SpendSmart

Description: SpendSmart makes saving receipts and tracking your budget effortless with the power of AI. Unlike most receipt managers, SpendSmart requires only a photo of your receipt to log a new expense. It automatically extracts key information, categorizes purchases intelligently, and presents everything in a beautifully designed interface.
