**Name**: Remime iOS

**Description**: It is a minimalistic time management application which includes a timer, a stopwatch, clock , and a pomodoro mode.
The thing that makes it different from other applications is that its design is based on catppuccin and I couldn't find similar applications with that color scheme.
Its made to be extremely user friendly and simple. It helps users to focus properly and work efficiently with the pomodoro mode, and properly monitor time with the other tools.

**How did you build this**: I used React Native and Expo to create this application. I started with the Documentation, but found it a little confusing,
so I searched for a youtube lecture on expo and react. After completing that, I could finally make this application.

**How many hours did you spend on this**: 20Hrs approx (15 hrs for coding, almost 3 hrs for the logo, 1hr for a scraped logo(made in aseprite with wakatime), and one hr for testing)

**Did you use wakatime to log your progress?**: Yes partially, the time for logo and testing are not logged:(
