**Name:** StudyQuest â€“ Productivity App

**Description**: I built this app because I saw a gap in productivity tools tailored for students and professionals. There were no apps that provided a seamless, structured way to manage tasks and optimize efficiency with a focus on usability. So, I created StudyQuest, a productivity app that includes a variety of features designed to help users stay organized, track progress, and maximize their workflow.
