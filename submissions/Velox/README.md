**Name**: Velox

**Description**: It is an app designed with games to improve mental math skills. The idea originated from a two-year project for my school's math event. Initially, it was a game where users guessed numbers based on provided clues. Over time, it evolved into a React app, and now it has been further upgraded into a full-fledged app with enhanced features.
