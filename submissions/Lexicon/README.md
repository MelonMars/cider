**Name**: Lexicon

**Description**: Lexicon is a free, secure, and open-source flashcards app for iOS. Like Quizlet, it has AI chat, learn mode, and test simulations. However, the AI Chat in quizlet is extremely limited and not particularly well-versed in many sectors of the wide range of topics students learn. My AI has unlimited access(just like my learn feature and test features) and also has access to web results to ensure it has the information it needs to ensure the users can succeed in school.

**How did you build this**: I used SwiftUI and a bit of ChatGPT tutoring which helped me learn new things about swiftui(i'm new to swift and swiftui)

**Did you use wakatime to log your progress?**: **Yes** / No - I had 43 hrs 8 min of hackatime and ~6 hrs of research online. There was ~20 hours of untracked data from before hackatime/wakatime v2 was launched where I didn't have the extension installed.

**Testflight link**: [https://testflight.apple.com/join/15cET7KM](https://testflight.apple.com/join/15cET7KM)

**How many users on testflight?**: 3 via testflight, the rest(mom, dad, sister, and ~5 friends) just tried it out on my xcode simulator on my laptop
